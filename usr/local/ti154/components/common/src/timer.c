     * --------------------
     * MAJOR ASSUMPTION: Timeout period is never
     * more then 1/2 the max value of an usngined int
     * (This translates to (47days/2) = 23 days)
     *
     * Step 1:
     *    Just subtract as unsigned
     * Step 2:
     *    Convert result to *SIGNED*
     * Step 3:
     *    If timeout is never > (unsigned max / 2)
     *       Then ... the SIGN (+/-) of the result
     *       tells us if it has expired or not.
     *
     * consider if the numbers where 4 bit
     * Here's the result of the math
     *
     * 4bit example
     *  END    NOW -> result
     *  0x4    0x1  -> 0x3 (positive) not expired
     *  0x1    0x4  -> 0xd (negative) expired
     *
     *  0xa    0xb ->  0xf (negative) expired
     *  0xb    0xa ->  0x1 (positive) not expired
     *  0x6    0xa ->  0xc (negative) expired
     *  0xc    0x1 ->  0xb (negative) expired
