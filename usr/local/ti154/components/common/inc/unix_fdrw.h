/*!
 * OVERVIEW
 * ========
 *
 * This file handles RD/WR operations for a Unix File Descriptor using rd/wr
 * and also handles any FIFO activty with respect to that FIFO
 *
 * Use cases:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li> Case #1 - (No Fifo involved)
 *      No fifo is involved, rd/wr the file descriptor.
 *
 * <li> Case #2 - (Read with Fifo)
 *       - for reading, there is a "read thread"
 *       - This read thread is blocked waiting for data
 *         when it gets data, it wakes up and fills the fifo.
 *       - When the APP reads, it reads from the FIFO
 *
 * <li> Case #3 - (Write with Fifo)
 *        Same idea as read with fifo
 * </ul>
 *
 * Logic is as follows:
 * \code
 *   if(fifo_handle == 0){
 *         we read/write the file descriptor directly.
 *         return
 *   } else {
 *         if(v_bytes==NULL){
 *              device rd_thread is active
 *              transfer bytes from fd to fifo
 *              return;
 *         if(c_bytes==NULL){
 *              device wr_thread is active
 *              transfer bytes from fifo to fd
 *         } else {
 *              FD is not used
 *              app thread is active
 *              transfer bytes from buffer to fifo
 *         }
 *   }
 * \endcode
